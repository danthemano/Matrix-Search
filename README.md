# Matrix-Search
This function searches for a value in an m x n sorted matrix

This function takes as input a m x n matrix with the following properties:
	-Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
	-The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

This function performs a binary search through the whole matrix.

Then time complexity for this function is O(logn) because it performs a binary search.

The space complexity for this function is O(1) because the only extra space we use if for 5 variables.
